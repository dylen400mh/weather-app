# Weather Forecast App

## Project Overview
This project is a Weather Forecast site that allows users to search for a specific location and view the weather information. The weather data is fetched using WeatherAPI. The main objectives of this project are to demonstrate skills in working with APIs, handling user input, processing JSON data, and dynamically updating the webpage.

The Weather Forecast site enables users to input a location in the search form or click a "current location" button and fetch the weather information for that location. The weather data includes details such as temperature, weather description, and metrics on humidity, wind, and precipitation. The site allows users to toggle between Imperial and Metric units.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Working with external APIs to fetch weather data based on user input.
- Handling user interactions by capturing and processing user input from the search form.
- Processing JSON data received from the API to extract and display relevant weather information.
- Implementing dynamic content updates on the webpage to show weather details based on user input and/or current location.
- Styling the webpage using CSS to create a visually attractive and responsive layout.
